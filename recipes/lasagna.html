    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces/170g) tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 cups (500g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 cups (200g) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make it!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic and cook until the onion is softened.</li>
        <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, followed by a third of the remaining meat sauce. Repeat this layering process with three more noodles, the remaining ricotta cheese mixture, and another third of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Top with the final layer of three lasagna noodles and spread the remaining meat sauce over the top. Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese and grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired. </li>
    </ol>
