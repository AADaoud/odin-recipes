    <img src="../images/brisket.gif" width="400" alt="Brisket"></img>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole beef brisket (10-12 pounds)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>Wood chips or chunks for smoking (such as hickory or oak)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make it!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preparing the Brisket:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Trim any excess fat from the brisket, leaving a thin layer (about 1/4 inch) on top to provide flavor and moisture during cooking.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, and cayenne pepper (if using).</li>
            <li>Rub the spice mixture all over the brisket, ensuring it is evenly coated. Wrap the brisket tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Preparing the Smoker:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Soak your wood chips or chunks in water for at least 30 minutes before smoking. This will help them produce smoke and flavor.</li>
            <li>Preheat your smoker to a temperature of 225-250째F (107-121째C) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Smoking the Brisket:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Once the smoker is ready, place the brisket directly on the grates, fat-side up.</li>
            <li>Add the soaked wood chips or chunks to the smoker box or charcoal for continuous smoke production.</li>
            <li>Close the smoker and maintain a consistent temperature throughout the cooking process. Check the smoker periodically to ensure the temperature remains steady.</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Cooking the Brisket:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Plan for a cooking time of about 1.5 to 2 hours per pound of brisket. However, cooking times can vary, so it's important to monitor the internal temperature of the meat for doneness.</li>
            <li>Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the brisket, being careful not to touch bone or fat. The brisket is done when the internal temperature reaches around 195-205째F (90-96째C), and the meat is tender when probed with a fork or meat thermometer.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li>Resting and Slicing:</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Once the brisket reaches the desired temperature, remove it from the smoker and loosely tent it with foil. Allow it to rest for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour. This resting period helps the meat retain its juices and makes it easier to slice.</li>
            <li>After resting, carefully slice the brisket against the grain into thin slices. Serve immediately and enjoy the flavorful, smoky brisket!</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy your smoked brisket!</p>
